issues
------
Think it makes most sense to run whonix setup right after qubes, then whonix can install qubes-whonix last.
hook into bfore qubes removes its links to repo


installing whonix after qubes-whonix; wq thinks its a template; tries to use proxy.  Need to add
a chroot option maybe' touch /var/run/qubes/qubes-service/choot and ignore everything; maybe even
in postinit?  -- gotta be sure IP addresses don't get changed

tests
-----

test all the vms listed below plus make sure each works with:

- netvm
- proxyvm
- sound
- notifications

NOTE: Backup EXISTING jessie-gnome; its what I use for web access!
      Make a special version name; test with that and copy my root.img to it after test as my future template to keep
wheezy
wheezy+gnome
jessie
jessie+gnome
whonix-gateway
whonix-workstation

# Before building ubuntu again; combine code base again
trusty
trusty+gnome
utopic
utopic+gnome

test qubes-whonix package update... at first just add a local file base repo in appvm


ubuntu fixups
-------------
network manager
application menus
- can I convert the hvm? -- or install real ubuntu from live but automated?
- combine codebase of ubuntu / debian

whonix fixups
-------------
move code to qhonix-qubes that can go there
see if I can get rid of grub yet with new APT-opts command
review all snapshot code; remove remerences to /run; swap with tmp

todo
----
add firfox, etc to installed apps like fedora has - gnome only build; keep minimum debian builds
flashplayer
mirror list
automated test? build, deploy to dom0, install guest + appvm, run some tests in appvm


condsider
---------
salt module; maybe can use for tests


merge
-----
merge to debian first
then from debian to master
then from master to ubuntu -- rebase whonix again
