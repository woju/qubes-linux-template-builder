This branch of linux-template-builder is only a stub to call a real build in
DispVM. It will:
1. Create disk image with all the files required to build the template,
2. Launch new DispVM
3. Attach that disk image to the new DispVM
4. Build the template there and shutdown DispVM
5. Extract ready root.img and build rpm package from it.

It will not mount or parse in any way root.img file. So even if some
installation scripts compromised root.img, your devel VM should be (reasonably)
safe.

By default the scripts will use "master" branch of linux-template-builder in
the DispVM, but you can change that with TEMPLATE_BUILDER_BRANCH environment
variable (for example you can set it in builder.conf).

To make all that working, you need to setup two Qubes RPC services:
 - qubesbuilder.ExportDisk
 - qubesbuilder.AttachDisk
And respective policies for them.
RPC services file are in "rpc-services" subdirectory, there are also example
policies - you need to update your devel VM name in qubesbuilder.ExportDisk
policy.
